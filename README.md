**OBJECTIVES**:

Create a user-friendly web application that retrieves data from a selected public API and presents it in an organized and interactive manner.
Key Requirements:

**API SELECTION**: Choose a public API that provides data of interest, such as weather information, news updates, or jokes.

**WEB APPLICATION STRUCTURE**: 
Design an intuitive interface that includes:

An input field for user queries (e.g., entering a city name for weather data).
A button to initiate the data retrieval process.
A section to display the fetched data clearly.
Responsive Design: Ensure the application is accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.

**ERROR HANDLING**: Implement mechanisms to handle potential issues, such as invalid user input or failed API requests, and provide appropriate feedback to users.

Implementation Steps:

Set Up the Project Environment:

Create a project directory and initialize it with essential files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.
Design the HTML Structure:

Develop the basic layout in index.html, incorporating elements like input fields, buttons, and display sections.
Apply Styling with CSS:

Use style.css to enhance the visual appeal and ensure responsiveness of the application.
Implement Functionality with JavaScript:

In script.js, write functions to:
Capture user input.
Fetch data from the selected API using asynchronous requests.
Display the retrieved data dynamically on the application.
Handle errors gracefully and inform users of any issues.
Testing and Debugging:

Regularly test the application to ensure all components function as intended.
Debug any issues that arise during development.
